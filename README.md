# DSUA301_Final-Project



In this project, we are going to perform human action recognition on images and evaluate the results. Through our implementations, we are able to recognize humanâ€™s actions in images and assign labels to each action. We tried to use a top-down approach. We are going to first implement YOLOv5 for object recognition and crop the human object to improve estimation accuracy. Then, we are going to fine-tune on pretrained Resnet-50 and VGG16 to classify human actions by optimized hyperparameters adjusted by Hyperband. Human Action Recognition is essential in machine learning development, and can be applied on various fields including VR technologies. Besides human actions, the model can also be adjusted and applied on gesture recognition.
